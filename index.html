<!-- ****** NOTE: Many things are missing to implement: 
One is to get user name from prompt,
Second to add timer and also chage the sentence of U win to u tooked this much time, 
Save the time taken in web storage and compare previous time taken to the current time taken,
Also after game overs just show options to restart the game,
With that do provide controllers for ball's sensitivity also (velocity of evil user), and also velocity of the game, 
Set the game mode (simple and time limit mode), in simple it will be as it is, in tough U will have to constraint time (this all settings U will need to ask while the game begging),
Also change the CSS of the page.
Handle alert with sweet alert
Make 4 such games and deploy it on freehosting site with a shining index page for all the games, and add it to your resume/ LinkedIn/ Blogger/ Stackoverflow etc.
